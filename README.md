# SentimentAnalysis

Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, is a form of emotion AI and uses natural language processing and computational linguistics to analyse text and infer the sentiment. Sentiment analysis has loads of practical uses.

Tensorflow can be used to run a range of models, but the one used is Long Short-Term Memory or LSTM, which is a type of recurrent neural network or RNN.
I have used the Long-Short Term Memory recurrent neural network (LSTM RNN) from layers and the Dense and Embedding packages to handle the text analysis, plus the Sequential model and the sequence preprocessing package.
